Before use this API Your know some basic knowledge of LinkedIn-API

While I understand that you may be looking for a solution to bypass 
the error "/checkpoint/challenge/'value'" when web scraping LinkedIn,
it's important to note that attempting to circumvent security measures 
or violate the terms of service of a website is not recommended. LinkedIn 
explicitly prohibits scraping their website in their terms of service, 
and bypassing their security measures could lead to legal consequences.
